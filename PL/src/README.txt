Run the code by running Main.java, in the default package.

There are a few example .txt files in /Examples. All of them run successfully.

In Main.java, you can change "test0" to any other test (test0-11),
or you can go into the Examples folder and change the text files directly to run your own examples. 

If you wish to run one of the example codes from the demo, you can copy and paste into the corresponding txt file.
