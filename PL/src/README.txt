Run the code by running Main.java, in the default package.

There are a few examples .txt files in /Examples. test0 to test3 runs successfully, test4 to test6 show syntax errors.

In Main.java, you can change "test0" to any other test (test0-6),
or you can go into the Examples folder and change the text files directly to run your own examples. 

We have implemented a lexer, parser, and interpreter for numbers, bools, if statements, variables, and strings. 

Note that the classes Tokenizer, Token, Node, LookAheadBuffer are from CS 2112 Critter world, albeit modified for our language.
