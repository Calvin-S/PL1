Run the code by running Main.java, in the default package.

There are a few example .txt files in /Examples.
test_ to test_ run successfully, while test_ to test_ show syntax errors.

In Main.java, you can change "test0" to any other test (test0-8),
or you can go into the Examples folder and change the text files directly to run your own examples. 

We have implemented a lexer, parser, and interpreter for numbers, bools, if statements, 
while loops, variables, strings, lists, and type matching. 

Note that the classes Tokenizer, Token, Node, LookAheadBuffer are from CS 2112 Critter world, albeit 
modified for our language.
